The Baird's tapir is named after the American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird,[6] who traveled to Mexico in 1843 and observed the animals. However, the species was first documented by another American naturalist, W. T. White.[7]

Like the other American tapirs (the mountain tapir and the South American tapir), the Baird's tapir is commonly called danta by people[who?] in all areas.[where?] In the regions around Oaxaca and Veracruz, it is referred to as the anteburro. Panamanians, and Colombians call it macho de monte, and in Belize, where the Baird's tapir is the national animal, it is known as the mountain cow.

In Mexico, it is called tzemen in Tzeltal;[citation needed] in Lacandon, it is called cash-i-tzimin, meaning "jungle horse"[citation needed] and in Tojolab'al it is called niguanchan, meaning "big animal".[citation needed] In Panama, the Guna people call the Baird's tapir moli in their colloquial language (Tule kaya), oloalikinyalilele, oloswikinyaliler, or oloalikinyappi in their political language (Sakla kaya), and ekwirmakka or ekwilamakkatola in their spiritual language (Suar mimmi kaya).
